# nsh (Naija Shell)

A custom Linux shell built from scratch using C++! This project is my first step into understanding how shells work, and I plan to enhance its functionality as I learn more.

## Features (Current)
- Execute basic Linux commands (`ls`, `pwd`, etc.).
- Handle arguments for commands.
- Built-in command: `exit` (to terminate the shell).
- Forking and process management for running commands.

## Planned Features
As I learn more about shells and system programming, I aim to add:
- Support for environment variables.
- Input/output redirection.
- Piped commands (`|`).
- Command history.
- Background execution (`&`).
- Tab-based auto-completion.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- GCC/G++ compiler
- Linux operating system

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
